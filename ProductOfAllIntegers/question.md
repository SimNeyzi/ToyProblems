You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.

Write a function getProductsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

For example, given:

  [1, 7, 3, 4]

JavaScript
your function would return:

  [84, 12, 28, 21]

JavaScript
by calculating:

  [7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]

JavaScript
Here's the catch: You can't use division in your solution!
